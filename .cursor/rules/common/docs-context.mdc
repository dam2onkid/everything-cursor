# Documentation Context

## Project-Level Docs

Before starting any task, check if `docs/overview.md` exists. If it does:

1. Read `docs/overview.md` FIRST — it is the project index
2. Navigate to specific docs ONLY when relevant to the current task:
   - Architecture questions → `docs/architecture.md`
   - UI/UX or styling → `docs/design-system.md`
   - Database or data models → `docs/database.md`
   - API endpoints or conventions → `docs/api.md`
   - Roadmap or priorities → `docs/roadmap.md`
3. Do NOT read all docs at once — progressive disclosure reduces context waste

## Feature-Level Docs

Feature docs live in `docs/features/{feature-name}/`:
- `README.md` — feature overview and sub-feature index
- `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `implementation.md`, `testing.md`

Read feature docs only when working on that specific feature.

## Documentation Hierarchy

```
docs/overview.md              ← Always read first (project index)
docs/{architecture,design-system,database,api,roadmap}.md  ← Read on demand
docs/features/{name}/         ← Read when working on specific feature
```

## Commands

- `/init-docs` — Generate all project-level docs from codebase analysis
- `/sync-project-docs` — Update all project-level docs when codebase changes
- `/init-feature` — Initialize feature-level docs
- `/update-feature-doc` — Update a specific feature document
