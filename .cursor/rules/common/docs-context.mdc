# Documentation Context

## Project-Level Docs

Before starting any task, check if `docs/overview.md` exists. If it does:

1. Read `docs/overview.md` FIRST — it is the project index
2. Read `VERSION.md` when you need the current version or feature statuses
3. Navigate to specific docs ONLY when relevant to the current task:
   - Architecture questions → `docs/architecture.md`
   - UI/UX or styling → `docs/design-system.md`
   - Database or data models → `docs/database.md`
   - API endpoints or conventions → `docs/api.md`
   - Roadmap or priorities → `docs/roadmap.md`
4. Do NOT read all docs at once — progressive disclosure reduces context waste

## Feature-Level Docs

Feature docs live in `docs/features/v{MAJOR}/{feature-name}/`:
- `README.md` — feature overview and sub-feature index
- `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `implementation.md`, `testing.md`

The `{MAJOR}` is the major version number from `VERSION.md` (e.g., `v0.1.0` → `v0`).

If a feature was carried over from a prior major version, its docs reference the old version at `docs/features/v{PREV_MAJOR}/{feature-name}/`.

Read feature docs only when working on that specific feature.

## Documentation Hierarchy

```
VERSION.md                       ← Current version, feature statuses, release history
docs/overview.md                 ← Always read first (project index)
docs/{architecture,design-system,database,api,roadmap}.md  ← Read on demand
docs/features/v{MAJOR}/{name}/   ← Read when working on specific feature
```
